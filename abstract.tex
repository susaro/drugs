%This thesis examines.. examine/investigate
The aim of this thesis is to investigate the rebinding effect, which occurs when projecting a Markov process onto a finite state space and may spoil the Markovianity.
%Based on the assumption

Under the assumption of a a fuzzy clustering in terms of membership functions $\chi = XA$, being a linear combination of Schur vectors,
a minimal bound for the rebinding effect included in a given system is computed as the solution of an optimization problem. %kinetics
