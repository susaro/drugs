In section \ref{sec:galerkin}, we introduced a method/technique to reduce the dimension of a Markov process by projecting it onto a smaller state space.
But we don't know yet \textit{how} to choose a partition of unity such that the corresponding Galerkin projection yields a \textit{reasonable} Markov State Model, in the sense that important properties of the process are maintained.
The answer to the question,  what an \textit{important property} is, can differ from case to case.
For our investigations (and many other research in MD systems), we are particulary interested in the long-time behaviour of a process, which can be characterized by the concept of \textit{metastability}.
It describes the typical behaviour of rare transitions between specific subsets, called \textit{metastable} or \textit{dominant subsets}, after a long duration of stay inside.
%aforementioned
We will see why it makes sense to project the process onto its metastable sets and how they are related to the spectrum of the transfer operator.

We will also see that the optimal metastable decomposition is not sharp/crisp but soft/fuzzy using \textit{membership functions}.
%using membership functions, in terms of membership functions
%membership fct. = part. of unity? Here: yes. Röblitz: required that each function takes value 1

For a nonreversible process, such a dominant structure can sometimes be given in terms of \textit{dominant cycles} instead of \textit{dominant sets}. We will introduce these structures as well and give a short outlook/overview how they can be detected.

\section{Metastability}
\label{sec:metastability}

There exist several different definitions of metastability. Shortly said, metastability is the property that the state space of a process
%can be for arbitrary stoch. proc.?
%which has subsets/regions
consists of subsets/regions s.t. transitions between these subsets are rare events while the duration of stay inside of each of these subsets is rather long.
%(a decomposition into?)
%stays for a long time in certain subsets before moving to other subsets. \marginpar{schlecht beschrieben}
Some possible characterizations of that behaviour are based on large hitting times or small exit rates, see Sch\"utte and Sarich\cite[chapter 3]{schutte2013metastability} which gives a good overview of the most common definitions.
%relation/comparison

\subsubsection*{Mathematical concept of metastability}

%define, introduce. In order to..
In order to describe the concept of metastability, it is a good way to start with so called \textit{stable} or \textit{invariant subsets}. A subset $A \subset \X$ of the state space of a Markov process $X_t$ is called stable or invariant if it cannot be left, i.e. if $\Prob(X_t \in A \mid X_0 \in A) = 1$ for all $t$.
%Similarly
%$A \subset \X$
Analoguously, we can define a \textit{metastable} or \textit{almost invariant subset} as a subset in which the process will stay for a very long time before exiting it into any other subset; that is $\Prob(X_{t_f} \in A \mid X_0 \in A) \approx 1$ for a convenient timescale $t_f$.
%Metastability: A subset is not invariant but almost invariant
%Consequentially
Thus, a full partition $A_1,\dots,A_m$ of the state space $\X$ is called \textit{metastable} if
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:metastability}
\sum_{k=1}^m \Prob_\mu(X_{t_f} \in A_k \mid X_0 \in A_k) \approx m.
\end{equation}
%mu??
Then each of the sets $A_k$ is almost invariant with respect to timescale $t_f$;
the probability to stay in one of the partition sets being started there is almost $1$, while the probability to change between any two different partition sets is almost $0$.
Such a partition is also called a \textit{metastable decomposition}.
%of the state space?

Obviously, being ``close to 1'' or ``close to $m$'' are rather vague statements. But that lack of concreteness will be eliminated later,
%However,
since we will only be interested in the ``best'' metastable decomposition.
That means that we want to obtain a decomposition where the sum \eqref{eq:metastability} is as close as possible to $m$, or equivalently the probability to stay inside of a metastable set is as close as possible to $1$.
%High holding probability?
%That means that we want to obtain a decomposition where the probability to stay inside of a metastable set is as close as possible to $1$, resulting in the sum \eqref{eq:metastability} being as close as possible to $m$.
%so for each metastable set we try do get that probability as close to 1 as possible.
Also the choice of the timescale $t_f$ is not specified in general and will depend on the particular system in consideration.
%system/question in consideration/investigation.
%case.
Hence, the only parameter in \eqref{eq:metastability} that has to be determined is the number $m$ of subsets we are looking for. \marginpar{def. conformation?}
%determined before
\\

\marginpar{membership fct, cluster, metastability, macro state}
In section \ref{sec:galerkin}, we defined the Galerkin projection on an arbitrary partition of unity $\{\cfam\}$, instead of defining it just on full partitions. Such a partition of unity (membership fcts.) defines a projected transfer operator $P_c$.
Then the trace of $P_c$ is referred to as \textit{metastability} of the conformations $\{\cfam\}$.
%why that makes sense? high diagonal elements -> high eigenvalues -> high metastability
%projected transfer operator from theorem...
This definition of metastability corresponds to the full-partition formulation \eqref{eq:metastability}, since the projected process has the state space $\{\cfam\}$. Therefore, the diagonal of $P_c$ consists of the holding probabilities of the conformations.

\subsubsection*{Metastability in Molecular Dynamic Systems}
%\marginpar{results in need for clustering}

Metastability is a very important concept for stochastic processes describing molecular dynamic systems.
%a realization
Such processes often have the characteristic behaviour that their trajectory stays inside of a certain
%switching/changing/exiting. region/subset
region, also called \textit{conformation},  for a long time before switching to another region. Furthermore, transitions between these conformations are rare. \marginpar{conformation = spatial arrangement? special case of metastability?}
%So this behaviour
%So these regions
So they correpond to our above definition of metastable sets if we choose a convenient timescale.
% long duration of stay + small transition rates/probabilities/ rare transitions between these subsets

	\caption{Example of a molecule with two (metastable) conformations}
\end{figure}

%examplified
This behaviour is depicted in figure \ref{fig:conformations}, taken from ... . This example shows a molecule, whose dihedral angle can take values between $+45°$ and $-45°$, thus the process consists orginally of infinitely many states.
But we can see, that there are two regions (red and blue) where the process stays for a rather long time and that transitions between these regions are rare. Thus, they correspond to our characterization of metastable sets.
\\

%\subsubsection*{Problem of long-time simulations of MD systems}

%Metastability -> long Verweildauer in conformation -> long-time simulations required
%Long-time simulations -> not feasible with nowaday computers -> need reduction of dimension

%Because of that fact, rather long simulations of the system are required if we want to know more about %these "conformation changes".

As transitions between metastable sets are a rather rare event, we need to make long-time simulations of our process in order to get reasonable results about these changes of conformations.
But, as mentioned in Chapter \ref{chap:markov}, long-time simulations of such complex systems are not feasible even with the best computers nowaday, see (...).
%Unfortunately..

Thus, in order to be able to compute some long-time simulations of a given MD system, a reduction of complexity  is needed/required. This can be achieved by a clustering of the state space as described in section \ref{sec:galerkin}. Different states of the state space will be clustered appropriately s.t. we get a process on a smaller state space.

\subsubsection*{Clustering into metastable sets}

So far, we didn't mention how we should choose the clusters/macro states/membership fcts. for the Galerkin projection, i.e. wich states of the original process should be grouped together for the reduced model. %\marginpar{Galerkin = clustering?}
%projected model

%cluster/group together
As we are mainly interested in the long-time behaviour of a given process, it seems reasonable to cluster states of a metastable set together and create a new process where each (macro) state corresponds to one of the metastable sets. The transition probabilities of the clustered process/reduced model should correspond to the transition rates of the original process between its metastable sets. \marginpar{micro/macro states}
%between the macro states
%In order to..
%maintains..
As metastability describes a behaviour on long timescales, our newly created process should maintain the long-time behaviour of the original process, but \textit{forget} about its short-time transitions, i.e. transitions inside of a conformation/metastable set.

Since there is not one unique metastable decomposition of the state space, we need to find a decomposition which is in some sense ``the best''; then we can use it to create a reduced model. In sections \ref{sec:spectral} and \ref{sec:fuzzy} we will see how to find such a decomposition.

%clustering not unique: different metastable decompositions
%For example: in which metastable set should we assign a
%transition region (e.g. a region which is close to several metastable sets). SOLVED BY MEMBERSHIP?

%Going from micro states to macro states.

\subsubsection*{Advantages / Disadvantages} \marginpar{weg?}

Most importantly, our newly created process will have the desired property of a reduced dimension/complexity since the model acts on a smaller state space while maintaining the crucial property of the original process (transitions between metastable sets = long-time behaviour). So the computation effort for (long-time) simulations is definitely decreased.
Furthermore, we get a better overview of our process, since it is always easier to consider a process on a few states in comparison to a process on a very large or even continuous state space. Since fast/short-time transitions (transitions inside conformation/metastable set) are not our research goal, we just omit these (at least for our case!) superfluous informations.
But there is also a disadvantage, as already mentioned in section \ref{sec:recrossing}, by projecting a process it can lose its Markov property.
