\section{Dominant cycles (non reversible NESS process)}

\subsubsection*{Approaches for nonreversible processes}
What is the dominant structure of a nonreversible process? cycle?
What is egentligen the problem with nonreversible processes? non-real eigenvalues
\\

How can the computation of dominant cycles help to detect metastable sets/ metastables cycles?
\\

What is a metastable cycle?

Definition dominant cycle

\subsubsection*{Schur Decomposition}
%[djur] chap 5
%same as PCCA+ but for nonreversible processes, so with Schur vectors instead of eigenvectors
Dominant structures will be defined utilizing the dominant Schur vectors
of the transition matrix instead of its eigenvectors.

A membership matrix can be defined as a linear combination of these Schur vectors.
