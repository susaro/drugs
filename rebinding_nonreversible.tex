\section{Approach for nonreversible processes}
\label{sec:rebinding_nonreversible}

With the tools from section \ref{sec:nonreversible} (Schur Decomposition and G-PCCA+) we give an approach how this problem can be solved
for nonreversible processes (NESS processes) using Schur Decomposition to get rid of the possibly nonreal eigenvalues, see Djurdevac et al\cite{djur2016}(2016).

\subsubsection*{Transfer Operator}
Have the transfer operator $\Pcal$ from \eqref{eq:transferoperator} given, but from theorem \ref{thm:selfadjoint_reversible} we know that the transfer operator of a nonreversible process is not self-adjoint.

\subsubsection*{Schur Decomposition}
Applying a Schur Decomposition, we can create real eigenvalues from the possibly nonreal eigenvalues of the transfer operator.

\subsubsection*{Galerkin Projection}
Now that we have real eigenvalues, we can apply the Galerkin Projection as usual. \marginpar{G-PCCA+?}
